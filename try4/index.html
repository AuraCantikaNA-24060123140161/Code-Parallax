            The parallax effect is a captivating visual phenomenon where objects closer to the observer appear to move faster than objects in the background as the observer's position changes. This occurs because the observer's angle of view towards the objects changes, consequently altering their relative positions. Imagine sitting in a moving train. Trees and buildings near the railway tracks seem to zip past swiftly while distant mountains remain seemingly static. This is because the trees and buildings are closer to you, causing your angle of view towards them to change more rapidly as the train moves. The parallax effect can be observed in various scenarios, including when you move your head, travel, or view photographs. Photographers employ it to create depth illusion in images, while video games utilize it to deliver a sense of realism and immersion. Astronomers even leverage it to measure distances to stars and other celestial objects. <br><br>
